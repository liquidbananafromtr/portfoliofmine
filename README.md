### About the Project

This is my personal portfolio crafted in early 2026 — a showcase of ultra-modern glassmorphism design combined with smooth motion animations, 3D particle systems, and cinematic scroll effects.

Built from scratch in a few intense days to demonstrate the level I’ve reached at age 15.

### Key Features

- Advanced glassmorphism with multi-layer blur, gradients & dynamic lighting
- Custom interactive cursor (dot + animated outline)
- GSAP + ScrollTrigger powered animations (reveal, parallax, hover lift)
- Three.js particle background with mouse parallax and subtle sine-wave movement
- Fully responsive across devices
- Clean, modern typography stack: Cormorant Garamond + Montserrat
- Dark aesthetic with luxurious, high-end feel

### Tech Stack

- HTML5 + CSS3 (Tailwind CSS via CDN)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- GSAP 3.12 + ScrollTrigger
- Three.js (custom particle system)
- Google Fonts

### My Background

- Linux enthusiast — Arch & Artix user since age 11 (5+ years daily usage, openrc/runit, deep troubleshooting)
- Hackintosh experience — 2+ years building, maintaining & optimizing EFI setups
- Python developer with automation & scripting background
- Self-taught hardware & low-level enthusiast (BIOS flashing, laptop recovery)

### Mission

Prove that age is irrelevant when passion and discipline meet.  
Next milestone: own a Cybertruck and build a business in Miami by age 19 (2029).
